; boot.s -- The very first bytes and instructions GRUB sees in the kernel.

; GRUB scans the early kernel image for the Multiboot header below.  Once it
; loads us, it jumps to start in 32-bit protected mode with EBX pointing at its
; multiboot_info structure.  No C runtime exists: this file passes arguments
; to main using cdecl and provides the permanent fallback loop if main returns.
